# Opal-Browser
Browser Made With CEF and Electron Uploaded For UMSL To View

# Notes
This app uses many dependencies from the NodeJS repositories, and 
one static library (easily identifiable because it is the only 
folder with a ridiculously long name)

# Requirements
NodeJS,
npm,
electron,

# Running The app
(This app does not have a packaging process because I never wanted to run it in a packaged form since I was using it to learn, so it gets executed like an interpreted language would, like python.)

Step 1: clone this repo (git clone) or download it as a zip

Step 2: navigate into directory and then navigate into 'Opal-Browser-main'

Step 3: Run: npm install

Step 4: Run "electron ./"

The app should then start up in non-packaged version
